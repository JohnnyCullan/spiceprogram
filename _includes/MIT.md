MIT License
-----------

The MIT License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms. Such proprietary software retains its proprietary nature even though it incorporates software under the MIT License. The license is also GPL-compatible, meaning that the GPL permits combination and redistribution with software that uses the MIT License.

This means that you can do whatever you want as long as you include the original copyright.

According to FSF, MIT License is not ambiguous, since it can refer to their Expat License or their X11 License. The license published by OSI is the Expat License. The difference is a single clause; X11 forbids using the copyright holder in advertising, promotion or any other dealings without a prior written authorization.
