#### Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2)

This is a lenient license used by the Mozilla Corporation that allows you a variety of explicit freedoms with the software so long as you keep it open source, under this license. It is a good midway license; it isn't very strict and has only straightforward requirements.

The MPL has been approved as both a free software license by the Free Software Foundation and an open-source software license by the Open Source Initiative. The MPL allows covered source code to be mixed with other files under a different, even proprietary license. However, code files licensed under the MPL must remain under the MPL and freely available in source form.

Unlike strong copyleft licenses, code under the MPL may be combined with files under any license in a larger work, as long as conditions for the MPL are met for MPL covered components. The MPL treats the source code file as the boundary between MPL-licensed and proprietary parts, meaning that all or none of the code in a given source file falls under the MPL.
