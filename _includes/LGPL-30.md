#### GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.0 (LGPL-3.0)

You may copy, distribute and modify the software provided that modifications are open source. However, software that includes the license may release under a different license.

Version 3 of the LGPL was published in 2007. It seeks to provide guidance for lawyers rather than programmers. It incorporates (inherits) the terms and conditions of GPLv3, supplemented by additional permissions. This is a clear difference to LGPL-2.1, which is more of a standalone license.
