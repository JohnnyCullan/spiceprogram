#### GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)

The LGPL is a compromise between the strong copyleft of GPL and permissive licenses such as the BSD and MIT.  It is primarily used for software libraries, although it is also used by some stand-alone applications. Developers and companies can use and integrate LGPL software into their own (even proprietary) software without being required to release the source code of their own parts.

The LGPL 2.1 was designed to be a license written largely in plain English that would give programmers guidance on what they could do with the software.

The main difference between the GPL and the LGPL is that the latter allows the work to be linked with or used by any program, free or proprietary. The program can then be distributed under any terms if it is not a *derivative work*; a work based upon one or more preexisting works. If it is a derivative work, then the program's terms must allow for "modification for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications." 

Whether a work that uses an LGPL program is a derivative work or not is a legal issue. A standalone executable that dynamically links to a library is generally accepted as not being a derivative work. It would fall under the definition of a "work that uses the Library".
