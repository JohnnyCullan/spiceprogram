GNU General Public License, version 2.0 (GPLv2)
-----------------------------------------------

The GNU General Public License is the most widely used free software license. 

You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes in source files and keep all modifications under GPL. You can distribute your application using a GPL library commercially, but you must also provide the source code. GPL license has an optional "any later version" clause that can be omitted, but allows users to choose whether the original license terms apply, or new terms, as updated by FSF.

The GPL was written by Richard Stallman in 1989 for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. The goal was to produce one license that could be used for any project, thus making it possible for many projects to share code. It is believed that the copyleft provided by the GPL was crucial to the success of Linux-based systems. The major change in GPLv2 was that if somebody has restrictions imposed that prevent him or her from distributing GPL-covered software in a way that respects other users' freedom (for example, if a legal ruling states that he or she can only distribute the software in binary form), he or she cannot distribute it at all.

Examples of notable projects that have chosen GPLv2:

* [Linux Kernel](http://www.kernel.org "Linux Kernel")
* [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org/coding/lgpl-license.html "WebKit")
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source "Git")
