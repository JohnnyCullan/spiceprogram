Which license to choose?
------------------------

Our advice here applies primarily to software. If you have something else in mind, such as pictures, music or such, please check out the [Creative Commons](/creative-commons) section.

* [Licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition](http://opensource.org/licenses)
