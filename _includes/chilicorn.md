There has been talk about getting some statistics out regarding our [sponsored open source contributions](/oss-sponsorship). Since I find both pie charts and the most pies disgusting, I wanted to try something different. A map! Since making one properly (automatic generation, good look and feel, maybe some interaction magic on top of it) sounds like a lot of work, a proof of concept was in order. It's lovingly drawn with the most powerful proprietary tool of them all, MS Paint.

Our developers found it amusing, so we decided to share.

You can download the original BMP from [here](/assets/img/realm-of-the-chilicorn.bmp), or a larger PNG from [here](/assets/img/realm-of-the-chilicorn.png).

Now what the hell is a Chilicorn? It's our Open Source program temporary logo. Spice Program. Chili? Yeah!

A trustworthy designer is working hard on a version that is.. well.. a bit less ghetto :)

Here's how it came to be summarized in one pic:

That escalated quickly and in three days we had physical manifestations around the offices:
