There's been talk about getting some statistics out regarding the sponsored open source contributions... I've been thinking about it, and since I find both pie charts and the most pies disgusting, I wanted to try something different. A map! Since making one properly (automatic generation, good look and feel, some interaction on top of it) sounds like a lot of work, here's a proof of concept. It's lovingly drawn with the most powerful proprietary tool of them all, MS Paint:

<div class="row text-center">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
        <img class="padded-img" src="/assets/img/realm_of_the_chilicorn.png" alt="Map showing the OSS projects we have sponsored contributions to" />
    </div>
</div>

What the hell is a Chilicorn? It's our Open Source program temporary logo:

<div class="row text-center">
    <div class="col-sm-7">

    </div>

A trustworthy designer is working hard on a version that is.. well.. less MS Paint :)

Here's how it came to be summarized in one pic:

<div class="row text-center">
    <div class="col-sm-7">
        <img class="padded-img" src="/assets/img/chilicorn_birth.png" alt="Our new logo" />
    </div>

That escalated quickly and in three days we had physical manifestations:

        <img class="padded-img" src="/assets/img/chilicorn_mug.png" alt="Our new logo" />
    </div>
