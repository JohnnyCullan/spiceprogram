#### BSD 3-Clause and 2-Clause

BSD licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software. 

The BSD 3-clause license allows you almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the BSD copyright notice. You cannot use the names of the original company or its members to endorse derived products. 2-clause, or simplified BSD, permits endorsement to derived works.

The original license used on BSD Unix had four clauses. The advertising clause (the third of four clauses) required you to acknowledge use of U.C. Berkeley code in your advertising of any product using that code. It was officially done away with on July 22nd, 1999. The four clause license has not been approved by OSI.
