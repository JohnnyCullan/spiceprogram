#### GNU General Public License, version 3.0 (GPLv3)

The third version of the license (GNU GPLv3) was released to address some perceived problems with the second version (GNU GPLv2). GPLv3 was written by Richard Stallman with legal counsel. 

You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates of in source files and keep modifications under GPL. You can distribute your application using a GPL library commercially, but you must also provide the source code. 

One of the goals of GPL Version 3 is to prevent Tivoization; the creation of a system that incorporates software under the terms of a copyleft software license, but uses hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware.

Other changes relate to internationalization, how license violations are handled, and how additional permissions can be granted by the copyright holder.
