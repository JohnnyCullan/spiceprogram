#### Apache License (2.0)

The Apache License is a free software license written by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). The Apache License requires preservation of the copyright notice and disclaimer. 

A popular license that allows you much freedom with the software, including an explicit right to a patent. "State changes" means that you have to include a notice in each file you modified.

Unlike copyleft licenses, the Apache License does not require a derivative work of the software, or modifications to the original, to be distributed using the same license. 

It still requires application of the same license to all unmodified parts and, in every licensed file, any original copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices in redistributed code must be preserved (excluding notices that do not pertain to any part of the derivative works); and, in every licensed file changed, a notification must be added stating that changes have been made to that file.

Code under GPL version 3 and Apache License 2.0 can be combined, as long as the resulting software is licensed under the GPL version 3.
