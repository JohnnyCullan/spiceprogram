## Spice program
Our company both advocates and benefits of making use of open source software when we build software solutions for our customers. It is the one ideology that the majority of our people subscribe to.

The main purpose of this program is to advance that ideology in our operations, because it is the right thing to do and will make the world a better place. 

Being a company, the motivation is of course not entirely altruistic. We think taking the free software movement seriously will help us in recruiting like-minded people and in keeping our people motivated. It might, by proxy, lead us into knowing the tools we use by heart and thus make us more efficient. Hell, we might even get increased brand recognition out of this, if it flies.

But most of all, it is the right thing to do and will help us make the world a better place.

Trying to be honest here; starting a program like this in a business environment is not entirely unlike to walking on broken glass. It’s not dangerous like crossing a minefield, obviously, but perhaps akin to crossing the kitchen floor barefooted, after accidentally shattering your spouse’s favorite glass into a thousand tiny glistening sharp pieces. You are likely to hit a few of those, no matter how careful you navigate.

Even if you somehow manage to avoid them all, someone is going to be unhappy. If nobody else, then certainly Richard Stallman, if he ever learns of our endeavor.

Because business and social movements do not mix well. Sure, there’s all the fun stuff – hackathons for worthy goals (at company premises with free pizza and beer, but no paid overtime), sending people to related events (networking and scene marketing), arranging said events yourself (brand recognition), sponsoring individuals or projects with a feasible amount (good PR!), even open sourcing something you have built for your own use, to show you can also walk the walk. These are all good things and very much on our agenda!

But then you have the difficult things, the quicksand.  

You see, we are in the custom software and consultancy business of hourly wages and utilization rates.  Some of our customers look upon open source software favorably; some abhor the thought. We cannot afford the luxury of choosing our customers on this criteria, nor would we want to. Even in-house there may be people who are skeptical about this hippie nonsense. They are very much entitled to their opinion. Sometimes they are probably right. We are not really even trying to claim that proprietary software has no place in the modern world. We ARE, however, hoping for that place to grow smaller.

So there definitely be dragons. Can people decide not to work on projects that are entirely proprietary? Probably not. If the contract disallows (or does not specifically allow) open source contributions, even though open source software (with a permissive license) is used, is there anything we can do? Who will do it? How do we sell our projects, what kind of emphasis we put on OSS aspect? If some substantial amount of work is clearly outside any particular customer project and hence cannot be invoiced, but if would benefit one or multiple of our projects – what shall we do? Who will decide? How will we report, how will we follow up?

Ordering pizza, giving inspiring speeches, writing blog posts, rubbing elbows with the scene celebrities over beer and granting small Gittip budgets sounds much more fun, sexy and the most of all achievable. Definitely worth doing. Done well, we can afford some satisfied nods over celebratory pints of Free Beer.

If we manage to answer some of the quicksand dragons, we can do a victory dance. 

We would really like to dance.
