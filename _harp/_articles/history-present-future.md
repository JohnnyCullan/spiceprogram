## The brief history of free software
> "'Free software' is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer'." --Richard M. Stallman

This chapter is largely a summary of the Wikipedia article on History of Free and open-source software, complemented with some information and shameless opinions.

In 1950s and early 1960s the early software was free by definition, due to the academic nature of software development, as well as compatibility and porting requirements and the lack of a separate business model; the revenue was made with hardware, primarily. It was also a concern that closed source software would allow for backdoors used for clandestine purposes; it was virtually impossible to see what a software was doing when executed. With the recent leaks of what security agencies and large corporations have been doing, it is not a stretch to claim that this is today an even more valid concern...
 
 Late 1960s the software industry was becoming real business. Software was increasingly decoupled from the hardware business, requiring a separate business model. Restrictive licenses were drafted by lawyers to make this possible. ARPANET researchers used RfCs to develop telecom protocols. This collaboration eventually led to the birth of the Internet in 1969. Just as well, a decade later and we would have a plethora of competing commercial proprietary internets. 

 In early 1970s AT&T released early versions of UNIX. The software was free of charge, but users were not allowed to redistribute or modify them. In late 1970s and early 1980s charging for software licenses became a dominant business model for software companies and computer vendors. Legal restrictions were imposed, through copyrights, trademarks and other contracts. License enforcing through legal actions began. Software piracy was born. 

 In 1980s software was shared via BBS systems. Software written in BASIC and other interpreted languages could only be distributed as source code. There was a lot of freeware. Software modding became popular. Usenet provided a good collaboration channel for programmers. 

 In early 1990s the free software community received the first complete free operating system with Linus Torvald's kernel combined to GNU operating system. Debian, founded by Ian Murdock in 1993, committed to the GNU and FSF principles of free software. Linux adoption by businesses and governments began in late 1990s. Website-based companies emerged and made extensive use of free web servers, especially Apache HTTP Server. The LAMP stack gained popularity over expensive proprietary solutions. Freeware Summit organized by Tim O'Reilly brought together the leaders of free and open source projects. A developer vote decided on open source as a new term over sourceware. The Open Source Initiative was formed much to the disdain of Richard Stallman and the FSF, who felt that OSI was selling out on some core values. FSF and OSI remain the main schools of the movement and so remain their philosophical disagreement. Fortunately they also agree on many practical matters and work together for the common cause.

 Early 2000 big software corporations began to see free software as a threat to their business. Microsoftâ€™s Ballmer called Linux a cancer, referring to its copyleft license. In 2003 SCO made claims that Unix IPR had been copied into Linux kernel and decided to jump straight into the deep end of the pool by suing IBM. They definitely did not lack balls, but turned out they did lack most of the actual IPR they claimed had been violated. The case is still technically ongoing, even though SCO filed for bankruptcy in 2007, having lost multiple defeats in court. SCO allegedly received funding from Microsoft. 

 In late 2000s the availability and popularity of hosted distributed revision control services, such as GitHub, has reduced barriers on participating in free software projects. 

 In recent years the free software movement has seen some worrying corporate acquisitions, such as Sun Microsystems purchasing MySQL and Oracle purchasing Sun Microsystems. 

 Meanwhile open source project participation is growing exponentially and big players, such as telecom companies, are adapting or seriously considering free software alternatives to the 
 traditional proprietary software. Many new school IT houses and enlightened in-house developers are fighting the good fight, paving way for this tectonic shift. New business models are emerging; creating a popular web service and open sourcing it all would have in recent past been considered financially insane, today it is becoming a norm. 

 Many governmental institutions have adopted free software and open innovation as fundamental building blocks of a successful information society. For instance the Helsinki Region Infoshare program has since 2010 promoted open data publication in the metropolitan
 area of Finland's capital, opening up more than a thousand datasets online, allowing for 
 free development of applications. The US government has an Open Government National Action Plan that includes an Open Data Policy, with the aim of making information resources accessible, discoverable, and usable by the public, to help fuel entrepreneurship, innovation, and scientific discovery - to improve Americans' lives and contribute significantly to job creation. Developments such as these are certain to catch the attention of the big players in the industry. Hopefully they don't make a complete mess of it.
