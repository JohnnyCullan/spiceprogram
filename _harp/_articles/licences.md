## Popular free and open source licenses 
> "Liberty is the right to do what I like; license, the right to do what you like." --Bertrand Russel

A license is a contract. This contract can define rights, obligations and restrictions. Since business and people are difficult, there appears to be a need for a multitude of different licenses. 

Copyleft licenses require that the original license is applied to the modified work, to ensure that the software remains free. Permissive licenses (or non-copyleft licenses) allow distributors to add restrictions, go proprietary with their derived work, or even with the original work. 

You don't need to know about them all - there is a lot of information that you can look up when needed. However, to be able to navigate, it is important to know the basics. 

The licenses we have picked are the ones with the widest adoption. For some of them there are older relevant versions, in which case the difference to the latest is briefly described. If you are selecting a license for your work, there is also a separate [chapter](#selecting-a-license) dedicated for that.

There are of course other considerations. Free Software Foundation (FSF) maintains a list of licenses that they consider as free. They also list GPL compatible licenses. Using these you can combine code released under the other license with code released under the GNU GPL, in one larger program.
