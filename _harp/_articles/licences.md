## Popular OSS licenses 
> "Liberty is the right to do what I like; license, the right to do what you like." --Bertrand Russel

#### A license is a contract between the licensor and the licensee. This contract can define rights, obligations and restrictions. Since business and people are difficult, there appears to be a need for a multitude of different licenses.

#### You don't need to know about them all - there is a lot of information that you can look up when needed. However, to be able to navigate the OSS ocean, it's important to know the basics.

#### The licenses we have picked are the ones with the widest adoption. For some of them there are older relevant versions, in which case the difference to the latest is briefly described. If you are selecting a license, there is also a separate [chapter](#selecting-a-license) dedicated for that.

All the popular licenses are approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). There is a defined review process by the OSI Board, which strives to verify they conform to the Open Source Definition, are not duplicates and are overall not evil.

There are of course other considerations. Free Software Foundation (FSF) maintains a list of licenses that they consider as free. They also list GPL compatible licenses. Using these you can combine code released under the other license with code released under the GNU GPL in one larger program.
