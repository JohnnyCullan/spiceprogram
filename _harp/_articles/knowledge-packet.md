## OSS knowledge package
> "I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things." --Linus Torvalds

#### Open source software should be an interesting subject. It is also a rich subject; there is a lot to know. This document summarizes the relevant information we have filtered off the ocean of data - the internet.

#### We have a three layer presentation. The basic information everyone working with software should have. If you want to be an OSS contributor, you should also check the details. For further reading we will list a lot of links.

This document has been put together as a part of an OSS program for a [new school IT company](http://www.futurice.com "Futurice"). It is primarily meant to demystify the subject matter for people who sell, build or maintain custom software for paying customers. This puts a certain emphasis to business considerations like required effort, cost-efficiency and such.

Our focus also means we are not interested in preaching to the choir, contributing to research or participating in the philosophical debate. A lot of the information available on the subject of open source software is overly academic for business purposes. Consider this an OSS summary for people, who are not into OSS yet.
