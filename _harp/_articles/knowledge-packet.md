> "I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things." --Linus Torvalds

Free and open source software should be an interesting and rich subject; there is a lot to know. This document summarizes the information we find relevant. Consider this an OSS summary for people who aren't into it yet. 

If you work with software, any software, you should have a basic understanding of the concepts and mechanics of free and open-source software. For further reading there are a lot of links.

This document has been put together as a part of an OSS program for a [new school IT company](http://www.futurice.com "Futurice"). It is primarily meant to demystify the subject matter for people who sell, build or maintain custom software for paying customers. This puts a certain emphasis to business considerations like required effort, cost-efficiency and such. 

Using and creating open source software alongside proprietary is also a key issue, as the goal is not to open source everything. There will be proprietary components, customer-owned IPR and so forth. We accept this; it is in the nature of our business. However, having a sensible modular structure to the solutions will allow us to publish useful libraries and contribute properly to the development of the OSS components we select. 

Our focus means that we are not too interested in preaching to the choir, contributing to research or participating in the philosophical debate. A lot of the information available on the subject of open source software is somewhat academic for business purposes. This document attempts to be easy to digest, even if you are comfortable wearing a suit and tie to work.
