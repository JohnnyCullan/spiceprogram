## Why bother with OSS?
> "Open source isn't about saving money, it's about doing more stuff, and getting incremental innovation with the finite budget you have." --Jim Whitehurst, CEO, Red Hat

#### Because it is the right thing to do and the future of our profession. It will make your work better. It will make you better in your work. You get to show the world what you can do. Contributing to open source projects with high visibility and demanding will make you very good at what you do. Even better, people will learn you are awesome, and not by having to take your word for it. How to write a successful CV? Weak.

Lets look at the central components of the free software philosophy: *collaboration*, *transparency*, *sharing* and *empowerment*.

**Collaboration** yields tangible benefits regardless of the scale. When hundreds or thousands of people
contribute toward a shared purpose, everyone benefits. On the other hand, just a handful of people
working together usually produce higher quality than a single code warrior. Even two people, as long
as they can establish an efficient way of working.

**Transparency** forces any organization to produce value. It forces you to actually have values, since
you want to win and maintain the trust of your employees, your customers, the public. Trust is the
main asset of successful organizations today.

**Sharing** means releasing assets created by you for others to benefit from, making use of assets others have created, contributing to them. This goes against the conventional business paradigm of protecting jealously what is yours. Proprietary software is not dying, but the focus is shifting towards openness. This process is fueled by open innovation, competition for the best talent, regulation and many other substantial factors.

**Empowerment** at work occurs when people really take ownership of their work. When they feel that
they are contributing to some higher cause than just making money. With OSS we have the philosophical
arguments, building the better world and all that, coming together with the great personal benefit
of getting your name out there.
