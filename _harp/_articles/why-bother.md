## Why bother with OSS?
> "Open source isn't about saving money, it's about doing more stuff, and getting incremental innovation with the finite budget you have." --Jim Whitehurst, CEO, Red Hat

Because it is the right thing to do and the future of our profession. It will make your work better. It will make you better in your work. You get to show the world what you can do. 

Contributing to demanding high visibility open source projects will make you very good at what you do. Even better, people will learn you are awesome, and not by having to take your word for it. 10 tips on how to write a successful CV? Acing a pen-and-paper coding test at an interview? Weak sauce. Better skip the effort required to convince them you have the skills, by letting them browse your GitHub activity at their leisure. You can instead concentrate on discussing stuff that matters to you. 

Lets look at the central components of the free software philosophy: *collaboration*, *transparency*, *sharing* and *empowerment*.

Collaboration yields tangible benefits regardless of the scale. When hundreds or thousands of people
contribute toward a shared purpose, everyone benefits. On the other hand, just a handful of people
working together usually produce higher quality than a single code ninja. Even just two persons, as 
long as they can establish an efficient way of working.

Transparency forces any organization to produce value. It forces you to actually have values, since
you want to win and maintain the trust of your employees, your customers, the public. Trust is the
the main capital of successful modern organizations.

Sharing means releasing assets created by you for others to benefit from, making use of assets others 
have created and contributing to them. This goes against the conventional business paradigm of protecting 
jealously what is yours, like a dragon sleeping on a pile of treasure. What good is that treasure under 
your scaly bulk? It's probably not even comfortable. Proprietary software is far from dying, but the focus 
is shifting towards openness. This process is fueled by open innovation, competition for the best talent, 
government regulation and many other substantial factors.

Empowerment at work occurs when people really take ownership of their work. When they feel that
they are contributing to some higher cause than just money. With free and open source sofiware we have 
the philosophical argument, building the better world and all that hippie sweetness, coming together 
with the great personal benefit of getting your name out there.
